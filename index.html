            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="introduction_1">
                Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u> . Continue reading for an introduction to the
                documentation,
                Native Components, React, and more!
            </p>
            <h2>Core Components</h2>
            <p class="core_2">
                React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
                app
                platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                well as
                to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
                code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in
                React Native.
            </p>
            <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>
            <div class="react_3">
                <p>
                    React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                    get
                    you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                </p>
                <div class="react_3_div1">
                    We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                    approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                </div>
                <p class="react_3_p1">
                    <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                    JavaScript like
                    so:<mark>< Text>Hello, I am your cat! < /Text></mark>. The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                    Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
                    cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                    <mark>< Text></mark>.
                </p>
                <div class="react_3_div2">
                    <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                </div>
                <p>
                    <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                    render, state
                    is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                    time or
                    that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>
            <div class="handling_4">
                <p>
                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that
                    takes
                    a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                    function to
                    be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p class="handling_4_p2">
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language.
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
                    Bob"
                    would be translated as "üçï üçï".
